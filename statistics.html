  First, let's see in which countries these 1000 top rated movies on IMDB have been produced. 
  The red dots on the map indicate, that at least one of the movies was made in that country, and the bigger the dot, 
  the more movies have been produced in the respective country. The plot shows that the majority of the top rated movies on the IMDB list is
  produced in USA. This must be expected, since the movie industry in Hollywood is very big and thus, it is natural that many of the top rated movies
  are produced here. However, the plot also shows that severa movies on the list have been producd in the United Kingdom, India and Japan.

  Next, we want to get an overview of how much the movies have cost to produce and how much revenue they have generated. This is shown in the table
	below together with an overview of the average sentiment scores of the movies. The average sentiment scores is based on the plot synopsis of 
	the movies together with the keywords listed for each movie. The table shows, that there is a very large span between the movies that have been 
	most and least expensive to produce just like the span for the income is very big. This should of course be considered in the light of the movies
	being released between the 1920s and 2020, so inflation should naturally be considered when evaluated the numbers. However, there is span is still
	very large, so in <a href="/genres">Genres</a> we will further investigate if some type of movies are more expensive to prodcue than other.

  To dig deeper into the sentiment scores of the movies the three happiest and three saddest movies, based on these average sentiment scores, are shown below. 	
</div>	
<div class="newimagebox">

<div class="textbox">	 
	The table shows that the happiest movie is <i> Mary Poppins </i>, which indeed is known to be a very happy movie. The names of the two saddest movies,
   <i>The Raid: Redemption</i> and <i>I Saw the Devil</i>, includes words that are usually associated with something negative, so it makes sense that
   these are listed as the most sad movies. 
	<br> 
	<br>
   Since we wish to look at the network of actors, we also find the happiest and saddest actors. This is based on the average sentiment scores of the movies 
  they have starred in. We choose to only include actors that have starred in at least five of the movies on the IMDB list, since otherwise actors that 
  have only starred in one, very happy movie will be considered the most happy and similar for the saddest. The table below shows the happiest and saddest
  actors based on this. It is shown that the span between the happiest and saddest actors is quite low, which suggests that the actors both appear in happy
  and sad movies.

  The histograms below show how many of the movies on the IMDB list that were produced in each decade together with the total number of actors that starred in 
  one of these movies in each decade. Note, that movies produced in 2020 are included in the 2010s.

<div class="centered-container">
  <iframe src="Plots/DecadeHistogram.html" height="466" width="1200"></iframe>
</div>
<div class="textbox">	
 The histogram to the left shows that in general the number of movies on the IMDB list increases from decade to decade. However, we observe that it is
 actually the 2000s that has the highest number of produced movies. This could indicate that the 2000s indeed was a decade where very good movies were produced. 
 The histogram on the right shows the number of actors that starred in a movie in each decade and it naturally also increases from decade to decade. 
 However, it is interesting that the two histograms are not exactly alike. We observe that in the actors histogram the high of the bars in the early decades
 are lower relative to the the corresponding bars in the movies histogram such that the increase in number of actors happens in a slower pace. This indicates
 that the cast sizes in the earlier decades were smaller, just like the variety in used actors might be bigger in the later decades. The network in each decade is
 investigated further under <a href="/timeline">Timeline</a>.

  The histograms below show the number of movies that fall within each genre together with the number of actors that have starred in a movie within each genre.
  The first histogram shows that <i>Drama</i> is by far the most represented genre among the movies on the IMDB list. Interestingly, the two histograms show that 
  even though <i>Comedy</i> is the third most represented genre, there have actually starred more actors within the genres <i>Crime</i> and <i>Action</i>. This
  can be explained by the fact that these type of movies often have a bigger cast than movies that are categorized as comedies.

	<h2 style="color:#443028;"> Graph of actors</h2>
  </center> 
</div>

	<p> </p>	
<center>
<div class="textbox">
Finally it is time to look at the network of actors. First, the basic statistics of the graph is shown. 	
  <img src="Plots/large_graph.png" alt="bar" width="600" height="300" style="float:left">
</div> 
	<p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </p>	
<div class="textbox">	
As expected, the whole graph consists of 28.862 nodes, which is consistent with the number of rows in the dataframe of actors. The graph has 1.057.799 edges, 
which represents the connections between the actors (nodes) in the network. Here, a connection (edge) between two actors (nodes) is based on the list of the 
1000 highest rated movies on IMDB, such that if two actors have participated in the same of these movies, they will be considered connected and thus, an edge 
will be drawn between them. Since it is possible that two actors have starred in more than one of these movies together, the dges have been given weights, such 
that an edge weight of e.g. 4 indicates that the two actors that are linked between this edge have starred together in four of the 1000 highest ratest IMDB movies.
<br>
It is observed that the lowest edge weight is 1 and the highest edge weight is 11. This means that two actors have actually starred together in 11 of the 1000 
highest rated movies on IMDB. However, it is also shown that the average edge weight is only 1.01 so in general, actors only star together in one of these movies.
<br>
Furthermore, the basic statistic of the degrees in the graph is found. Since an edge is drawn between two actors if they have starred in the same movie, this 
results in an undirected graph, where we just have degrees and no in- and outdegrees. The minimum degree in the graph is 3, whereas the highest degree of an actor 
is 1356. Since this is a weighted graph this does not necessarily indicate that the actor with this degree is connected to exactly 1356 other actors. This, since 
the actor could be connected to annother actor with an edge with weight 4, which will contribute to the degree count with 4 rather than 1. The degree distribution 
is investigated further below. 
<br>
We observe that there exists 26 connected components. However, the giant conencted component actually has 28.086 nodes, which corresponds to 97.3% of all nodes. 
This, despite the fact that the release year for the movies span from the 1920s to 2020. In that way it must be stated that the actors indeed are quite connected. 
Finally, we find that the average shortest path in the giant connected component is 3.55, meaning that in less that 4 steps all the actors in this component can 
reach each other. 	
</div>

<div class="textbox">
 The degree distribution of the network is visualized below both as a normal plot and on double logarithmic axis (log-log plot). 
 On the left side of the log-log plot the points falls on a straight line, which would indicate that the degree distribution follows a power-law, 
 which is consistent with the plot with normal axis, which has a very long tail, where a few actors have very high degrees. This would indicate that the network
 of actors is scale-free. However, the degree distribution does not strictly follow a power-law. The points with the lowest degrees actually appear to follow a 
 poisson distribution, which would indicate that the network was random. Hence, we observe tendencies from both kind of networks, even though the majority of points
 follows a power-law distribution. It is natural that the network cannot be completely random, since it is based on the casts of 1000 movies. Additionally, the 
 network is not completely scale-free since all actors will at least have a degree corresponding to the size of the cast in the movie they have starred in.

 Finally, the network is visualized below. The left side of the plot shows the entire network with all it's components, while the right side of the plot
 zooms in on the giant connected component. The node sizes have been adjusted relative to the degree of the nodes. Additionally, the edges between nodes 
 have been seperated into two groups; edges with a weight of 1, which indiactes that the actors have starred in one movie together, and edges with a weight 
 of more than 1, which means that the two actors have starred in several movies together. Edges with a weight of 1 is represented by a dashed, light brown 
 line, while edges with a higher weight is represented by a solid, dark brown line.
