   The image below shows the three actors/actresses who have starred in the most movies of a specific genre. The lists are dominated by actors of a certain 
	age who have been in the game for a while, and who have had plenty of time to star in a lot of movies. With ages 33, 36 and 42, Tom Felton, Scarlett Johansson and Zoe Saldana 
	are the youngest actors/actresses featured on the list. <br><br>
	
	For Tom Felton it is his role in the Harry Potter series, that gives him a high occurance within the 
	mystery genre, since 6 out of the 8 Harry Potter movies are featured on the list of the highest rated movies on IMDB and 5 of them are defined as mystery. 
	David Bradley and Timothy Spall, the two other most popular actors of the mystery genre, are also featured in most of the Harry Potter movies. 
	It should be noted that Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and the rest of the regular cast of Harry Potter have starred in as many movies within the 
	mystery genre as the three actors who were lucky enough to make it to the list.<br><br>
	
	For both Scarlett Johansson and Zoe Saldana, it is their recurring roles in sci-fi/action movies in the Marvel Universe that puts them on the list. 
	The list of the highest rated movies on IMDB features a lot of Marvel movies such as the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy etc.

   Have you ever wondered how much it costs to make a sci-fi movie compared to a romantic comedy? Or wondered whether the actors are particularly young or old in movies of a specific genre? 
	Don't worry - you don't have to wonder anymore! With the following statistical comparison of the genres, all your questions will be answered. <br><br>
	
	The bar plots below compares the following attributes for all 9 genres:
	
	<ul>
	  <li>The average estimated budget (cost of making) of a movie</li>
	  <li>The average age of the cast at the time where the movie was filmed</li> 
	  <li>The average <a href="/statistics#sentiment_score" style=color:#b30000>sentiment score</a> of a movie (based on the plot synopsis and key words) </li>
	  <li>The average size of the main cast of a movie</li>
	</ul>

	Hover the mouse over a bar to see which genre it represents. <br><br>
	
	<b> Budget </b><br>
	Adventure, sci-fi and action are by far the genres where the movie production is most expensive. 
	On average it costs twice as much to produce a movie within these genres than within the remaining 6 genres. 
	The differences are probably caused by the large expenses for special effects and stunt scenes which are often present in adventure, sci-fi and action movies.<br><br>
	
	<b> Age of cast </b><br>
	The difference in the average age of the cast within the genres is surprisingly small; most likely the group of actors present in a genre is so large, 
	that the number more or less reflects the average age in the data set. In order to get an impression of which genre uses e.g. the most child actors, 
	it would be necessary to take a closer look at the specific movies within each genre, or to look at the distribution of specific age groups within the genres.<br><br>
	
	<b> Sentiment score </b><br>
	Based on the average sentiment scores, the happiest genres are romance, comedy and drama and the saddest genres are action, crime and thriller. 
	This corresponds very well to the common perception of the genres.<br><br>
	
	<b> Size of main cast </b><br>
	We see a difference in the average size of the main cast in movies within the genres. The genres action, crime and sci-fi tend to have the largest main cast and 
	the genres romance, comedy and mystery tend to have the smallest. These trend make intuitive sense, since e.g. an action movie often have many scenes with a large 
	number of roles, such as fight scenes or scenes reflecting political events. On the other hand, a romantic comedy will often revolve around a small group of characters and the relations between them. <br><br>
