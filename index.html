   This webpage revolves around the network of actors and is made as part of the final project in the course <i>02805 Social graphs and interactions</i> at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in the fall 2020.	
	The web page contains an overview of the network of actors along with the results of different analyses performed on the network. For the technical details behind the analyses, we refer to the 
	<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1d7I5qb0cwo5LAuVFcNOjf9g_0QwAA-L_?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style=color:#b30000>Explainer notebook</a>. The data set and other files used to create this webpage can be 
	found on this <a href="https://github.com/network-of-actors/network-of-actors.github.io" target="_blank" style=color:#b30000>github</a>.<br><br>

	The data set is constructed specifically for this project and consists of a movies data file, and an actors data file. The data extraction is based on 
	the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?count=100&groups=top_1000&sort=user_rating" target="_blank" style=color:#b30000>list of the 1000 highest 
	user rated movies on IMDB</a>. Furthermore, a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026752" target="_blank" 
	style=color:#b30000> list of sentiments of words</a> is downloaded and used to compute average sentiements of the movies. 
	Based on the IMDB list we have created a data file of movies which after data cleaning consists of 862 rows and 15 attributes, 
	which are specified below: 
	<ul>		
		<li><b>MovieID</b>: Unique IMDB id of movie.</li>
		<li><b>Title</b>: Original title of movie.</li>
