   Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_method" target="_blank" style=color:#b30000>Louvain method</a> the best parition of the full graph (MÃ…SKE LINK?) into communities is found. 
	A total of 88 communities are found, and the six largest communities are selected for further analysis. <br><br>
	First let's take a quick look at the communitites. The table below lists the number of actors in the community (<b>number of members</b>), the number of unique movies
	which the community members have starred in (<b>number of movies</b>) the three members with the highest degree and the three movies which features the most of the community's members.

   Just from this quick overview, some possible tendencies are already visible; judging from the names of the actors of community 2 this community could represent the Indian
	movie industry. In community 3 the three most represented movies are all cartoons and since both John Ratzenberger and Sherry Lynn are voice actors frequently used by Disney, 
	this community could represent the animated movie industry. Finally, all three most represented movies of community 6 are created by Quentin Tarantino, which 
	also seems to indicate some kind of pattern.<br><br>
	
	We now dig further into the actors placed in the communities and into the genres, decades and countries which are represented in the communities through the actors.
