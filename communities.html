   Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_method" target="_blank" style=color:#b30000>Louvain method</a> the best parition of the full graph (MÃ…SKE LINK?) into communities is found. 
	A total of 88 communities are found, and the six largest communities are selected for further analysis. <br><br>
	First let's take a quick look at the communitites. The table below lists the number of actors in the community (<b>number of members</b>), the number of unique movies
	which the community members have starred in (<b>number of movies</b>) the three members with the highest degree and the three movies which features the most of the community's members.

   Just from this quick overview, some possible tendencies are already visible; judging from the names of the actors of community 2 this community could represent the Indian
	movie industry. In community 3 the three most represented movies are all cartoons and since both John Ratzenberger and Sherry Lynn are voice actors frequently used by Disney, 
	this community could represent the animated movie industry. Finally, both the three actors and the three movies shown for community 4 are British, so this community
	might represent the British movie industry. <br><br>
	
	We now dig further into the actors placed in the communities and into the genres, decades and countries which are represented in the communities through the actors.

   First, let's investigate whether any of the communities could represent a specific time period. The left plot below shows the average release year of the movies represented in each
	community through the actors. Furthermore, the range of the release years of the represented movies is shown with the end points being the minumum and maximum release year. Similarly, 
	the right plot shows the average birth year and the range of birth years for the actors in each community. <br><br>

<div class="textbox">
	For communities 2-5 the tendencies are quite similar. However, community 1 is different. The actors of this community tend to be significantly older than the actors
	of the other communities. Although some new movies are represented in the community, we generally see that a lot of older movies are represented compared to the other communities. Let's investigate
	these tendencies further. The left plot below shows the distribution of decades within each community, while the right plot shows the decade representation within the communities. 
	The distribution values are given by the fraction of movies represented in a community which was released in a specific decade. The representation is computed as the fraction of movies 
	released in a specific decade which are represented in the community.
